            <div><p class ="sectionContent">Donâ€™t let the weight of making a decisive turn into a stressful situation. Relax, take a breather, then come back and look at it again.</p></div>
            <div><p class ="sectionContentHeads">2. Be Objective</p></div>
            <div><p class ="sectionContent">Sometimes we get too close to a situation and we start to ruminate. Try taking a purely objective approach. List the pros and cons of the options available. This will help you to weigh your options and will give you more confidence about making the right decision.</p></div>
            <div><p class ="sectionContentHeads">3. Believe in Yourself</p></div>
            <div><p class ="sectionContent">Sometimes you have to make a snap decision, the situation calls for it. If this is the case, take a moment to pause and quickly consider your options, and then go for it! Once you have made a decision donâ€™t second-guess yourself.</p></div>
            <div><p class ="sectionContentHeads">4. Donâ€™t Rush It</p></div>
            <div><p class ="sectionContent">On the other hand, if the situation gives you time to make the decision, take it. Digest what information you have and look for any further information that will help you to make a strong, informed decision.</p></div>

            <div><p class ="sectionContent">Iâ€™m a great believer in gut instinct. I will usually look for the data to back up or even contradict what my gut is telling me. But I donâ€™t usually ignore it.</p></div>
            <div><p class ="sectionContentHeads">7. Donâ€™t Let a Fear of Failure Hold You Back</p></div>
            <div><p class ="sectionContent">Weâ€™re human after all, we are going to fail. Usually in direct proportion to what we attempt. If you donâ€™t make any decision then you wonâ€™t fail, but you wonâ€™t succeed either. Once you do make a decision, you have to take action.</p></div>
            <div><p class ="sectionContentHeads">8. Donâ€™t Be Afraid to Admit When Your Choice was Wrong</p></div>
